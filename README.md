# PvZ2C Recrafted
This is a repo for apks of PvZ2C from different providers with bypass 12 hours cooldown patch built-in. To download patch, navigate to [releases](https://github.com/CyberSteve777/pvz2c_recrafted/releases) page.

For base game download mirror, visit [this](https://github.com/Archiver2c/pvz2c-mirror/releases) repository.

Note:
- there's another patch built in - you can get your pp.dat from `android/data/<game-folder>/files` directory. There will be an extra folder, called `No_Backup`, where you can see the file. I'll give you a warning that editing pp.dat in 2c might result in account ban, so be careful with that

## Have a great day!
